## Basic usage

Sometimes you have an enum or union type, possibly a status, that has inherint order and you need to work with values as though they're ordered. The `series` function takes many values and returns an object that let's you do ordered logic on those values.

```ts
import { series } from 'radash'

type Weekday = 'monday' | 'tuesday' | 'wednesday' | 'thursday' | 'friday';

const weekdays = series<Weekday>(
  'monday',
  'tuesday',
  'wednesday',
  'thursday',
  'friday'
)

weekdays.min('tuesday', 'thursday') // => 'tuesday'
weekdays.max('wednesday', 'monday') // => 'wednesday'
weekdays.next('wednesday') // => 'thursday'
weekdays.previous('tuesday') // => 'monday'
weekdays.first() // => 'monday'
weekdays.last() // => 'friday'
weekdays.next('friday') // => null
weekdays.next('friday', weekdays.first()) // => 'monday'
```
