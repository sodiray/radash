description: Create a throttled callback function

## Basic usage

Throttle accepts an options object with an `interval` and a source function to call
when invoked. When the returned function is invoked it will only call the source
function if the `interval` milliseconds of time has passed. Otherwise, it will ignore
the invocation.


```ts
import { throttle } from 'radash'

const onMouseMove = () => {
  rerender()
}

addEventListener('mousemove', throttle({ interval: 200 }, onMouseMove))
```

## Timing

A visual of the throttle behavior when `interval` is `200`. The throttle function
returned by `throttle` can be called every millisecond but it will only call
the given callback after `interval` milliseconds have passed.

```sh
                Time: 0ms - - - - 100ms - - - - 200ms - - - - 300ms - - - - 400ms - - - -
Throttle Invocations: x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
  Source Invocations: x - - - - - - - - - - - - x - - - - - - - - - - - - - x - - - - - -
```

### isThrottled

The function returned by `throttle` has a `isThrottled` method that when called will return if there is any active throttle.

```ts
const debounced = throttle({ interval: 200 }, onMouseMove)

// ... sometime later

debounced.isThrottled()
```
