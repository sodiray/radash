## Keep it Simple

### Readable

The Radash source is easy to read and understand. We don't make you navigate through internal library modules and classes, reading a hundred lines of code, to understand what a function does or how it works.  

As an example, here's a look at [the source](https://github.com/rayepps/radash/blob/master/src/curry.ts#L11-L13) for the `_.compose` function.

```ts
export const compose = (...funcs: Func[]) => {
  return funcs.reverse().reduce((acc, fn) => fn(acc))
}
```

Thats it... thats the function.

### Semi-Functional

Functional programming has incredible design patterns that we often pull from. However, we're not die-hard functional engineers. You don't have to understand monads to use Radash. Most Radash functions are deterministic and/or pure.

## Safe

### Types

Radash is written in TypeScript and provides full typing out of the box.
